# MediaPipeUnityRT

Media Pipe Unity Real Time 

To launch the code : 

1 : Install the necessary python dependencies (There is a requirement.txt but it includes all the libraries of my venv
   most of which are useless and take a lot of space, better to use it only to get the versions and not to install everything)
2 : Put the Assets file in a Unity project (mine was in 2022.1.5f1) and launch the Mode run. Launch also the
  python file Python_MPURT/Project/main.py 
3 : Click on the "connect to Unity" button in the python interface
